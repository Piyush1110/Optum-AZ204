	- What is docker container?
		- Docker will will pack the application into a deployable box
		- The packed box is called image
		- From same image we can start multiple containers 
		- Container is the running instance of an application image.
		- For containerizing apps we need to install Docker CLI in your machine
			- Uses a Dockerfile to build the image
			- A Dockerfile is a textfile that contains the instruction to build the image.
	- What is ACR?
		- Docker Hub - Public repository of images
		- ACR - Azure Container Registry
			- Private 
			- Credentials required for Push and Pull 
	- how to build image
		- 
	- How to deploy container to ACI from ACR?
		1) az login

		3) Create image 
			docker build -t <imagename> .

		4) Renamed the image
			docker tag <myimagename> <acrloginServer>/<imagename>
			
		5) Push image to ACR
			docker push <acrloginServer>/<imagename>
			
		6) Complete steps 3+ 4+ 5 using a single command

		az acr build --image <acrloginServer>/<imagename>  --registry <acrname> <path>

		az acr build --image sonuregistry.azurecr.io/dummyapp:latest --registry sonuregistry .
			
API Gateway Service
	- Need for gateway
		- Client apps may need to store/remember multiple backend urls
		- Content type mismatch - JSON to XML /XML to JSON
		- Authentication cannot be added post deployment
		- Caching cannot implemented post deployment
		- Modification of response or request header is not possible
		- Replace text in response using find and replace
		- Control the number requests per minute (throttling)
	- AZure APIM
		- Fully managed PaaS service for Gateway purpose
		- 3 components
			- Publisher Portal (Azure Portal)
				- Used by API publishers
				- Configure the API backend in Gateway
				- Publisher Portal features are now integrated in Azure Portal
				- Products, APIS, Operations
				- Configure the Policies for APIs
			- Developer Portal
			- API Gateway
		- Policies
			- A set of rules that is configured by Publisher in gateway
			- Applied on Operation level, API level or Product level
				
Events and Message services
	- Communication patterns
		- Http Request/Response
			- It is nearly real time
			- The sender and receiver must be online
			- One-to-One communication
			- Response is mandatory, it is indicating the end of communication.
			- It is synchronous by default
		- Event Driven 
			- One app fire an event and one or more receivers can receive the event data.
			- One to many communication
			- Publisher-Subscriber pattern
			- Response is not mandatory
			- Asynchronous by default
			- Real time communication
			- Sender and receiver must be online
		- Message driven pattern		
			- It is not real time
			- One to many pattern supported
			- No response required
			- Asynchronous
			- Sender and receiver must not be online at the time of communication
	- Event Driven Services in Azure
		- Event Grid
			- It is an fully managed event ingestion service on azure
			- Created and managed by Azure
			- It is a built in service integrated with most of the Azure services by default.
			- Multiple subscriber apps can consume the event.
			- Terminologies:
				- Event - What happened
				- Event Publisher - Who generated the event/where the event generated
				- Topic - The channel used by publisher to publish event to EventGrid
				- Subscriber - The consumer of the event, there can be zero or more consumers
				- Subscription - the endpoint/channel through which the subscriber receives events
		- Event Hub
			- It is also Event ingestion system
			- Used for Big Data processing
		
	- Message Driven Services
		- We use a message broker service as an intermediate component.
		- Azure supports two messaging services:
			- Service Bus Queue
				- Costlier than storage queue
				- Used in Enterprise apps
				- Max message size is 256 Kb
				- Max TTL is 14 days
				- Duplicate detection supported
				- Dead letter queue support 
				- Support pricing tiers
				- Secured- Message is sent as encrypted and SB cannot read the message.
				- It follows FIFO order
				- Uses AMQP protocol(Advanced Message Queueing Protocol) 
			- Storage Account queue
				- Created along with Storage account
				- Storage queue uses HTTP as communication protocol
					= https://<storageaccname>.queue.windows.net/<queueName>
				- A message size is maximum 64Kb
				- the TTL (Time to Live) is max 7 days.
				- No Guarantee for FIFO
				- No Duplicate detection 
				- No message corelation
				- Message is sent as plain text
				- Cheap and more storage

Improve the app performance
	Azure Cache For Redis
		- Redis Database
			- It is a NoSQL database.
			- Key-Value pair data storage.
				- "Name"="Sonu"
				- "Address:HouseNo" = "C-205, Marina"
				- "Address:Street" = "Casa Rio",
				- "Address:City" = "Mumbai"
			- Open source database
			- Mostly used for caching storage not as a permenant database.
	Content Delivery Network (CDN)
		- Serve static content from nearby edge server to customers
		- Accessing data from the origin is giving high latency.
		- CDN helps to cache the static files in the edge server near to the customer.
		
Monitoring tools
	- Azure Monitor
		- Collects data about application
			- Metric
				- Numerical data about the app usage
					- Average CPU utilization
					- Average Memory utilization
					- Disk Usage
					- Egress and Ingress
					- No of failed requets
					- Average response time 
				- Used for generating alert conditions and scaling

			- Log Analytics 
			- Visualization 
			- Application Insights
		
		- Alerts
			- Alert rules
				- Alert condition
					eg: CPU Percentage > 70%
					eg: operation status =='Failed'
			- Action groups
				- A set of action need to be executed when the condition met
				- What to do when condition is met 
				- Action group can contain multiple actions:
					eg: Send Mail/SMS/Push to admin
					eg: Execute a Logic App or Function
					eg: Send a notification to webhook
					eg: Invoke Azure automation runbook (PowerShell script)
		- Application Insights
			- Collects telemetry about apps such as Availability, latency, failed and success requests 
			- Can create availability test
			- Application map to detect the app dependencies
			- Live metrics to see the live usage data
			
Authentication and Authorization
	- Azure Provided security
		- Default encryption
		- Virtual network security
	- User provided security
		- Forms based authentication (User databases)
		- OAuth authentication
			- Use third party identity providers like Facebook, google, Microsoft, Twitter etc
	- AAD Authentication	
		1) Register client Application in AAD
		2) Protected API(resource) must be registered in AAD
		3) Client App makes login request to AAD
		4) AAD verifies the username and pwd and send access token to client app
		5) Client App can now access protected resource using the token. It sends the token with request using Authorization header
		6) Resource verifies the token and allow access
