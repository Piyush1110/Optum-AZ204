		- Queue Storage (http based text message service)
	- Blob storage 
		- USed for storing unstructured blob data such as images, audio, video, archives 
		- Every blob has a unique Url that helps us to access the file
			https://sonustorage.blob.core.windows.net/images/mypics/pic1.jpg
		- Every blob need to be placed inside a container
		- Container is like a folder but not a folder.
		- Muutiple container can be created in blob storage, and each container can store multiple blobs
		- We can control access to the blobs in container using Container access control:
			- Blob Access control - (Anonymous) - read the blobs using the Url
			- Container Access control - (Anonymous) - read access to individual blobs also it allows to list blobs
			- Private access control - (Not anonymous- credentials required)

Azure Functions
	- Functions are serverless computing services.
	- No need to pre-provision the compute resources while creating services.
	- resources are allocated athe time of request execution. 
	- When more number of reqeusts are received the azure platfrm automatically scale the service.
	- Pricing is based on the number of requests * duration * per second cost
	- Two hosting available
		- Consumption model
			- First request execution always delayed
			- 5 minutes is the max execution duration. (optionally configure up to 10 mts)
		- AppService model
			- Uses an existing app service plan.
			- No additional cost for running functions
			- No time restriction
	- Function is a peice of code which is written in 
		- C# - Primary
		- Python
		- JavaScript(Node) - Secondary
		- Java
		- PowerShell
		- Bash 
	- Not used for web application development, used for doing atomic tasks
		- Send alert notifications
		- Convert image to other formation
		- encoding of documents
		- Mail sending 
	- Triggers and Bindings
		- Trigger is used to start the functions.
		- This will be some kind of events
			- New function arrived in queue
			- A new document added in cosmosdb collection.
			- A new blob is created in container
			- A new http request is received
			- Timer trigger - use CRON expression
		- Bindings 
			- Input binding - From where the fucntion can read data

	- What is docker container?
		- Docker will will pack the application into a deployable box
		- The packed box is called image
		- From same image we can start multiple containers 
		- Container is the running instance of an application image.
		- For containerizing apps we need to install Docker CLI in your machine
			- Uses a Dockerfile to build the image
			- A Dockerfile is a textfile that contains the instruction to build the image.
	- What is ACR?
		- Docker Hub - Public repository of images
		- ACR - Azure Container Registry
			- Private 
			- Credentials required for Push and Pull 
	- how to build image
		- 
	- How to deploy container to ACI from ACR?
		1) az login

		2) az acr login --name <acrname>

		3) Create image 
			docker build -t <imagename> .

		4) Renamed the image
			docker tag <myimagename> <acrloginServer>/<imagename>
			
		5) Push image to ACR
			docker push <acrloginServer>/<imagename>
			
		6) Complete steps 3+ 4+ 5 using a single command

		az acr build --image <acrloginServer>/<imagename>  --registry <acrname> <path>

		az acr build --image sonuregistry.azurecr.io/dummyapp:latest --registry sonuregistry .
			
API Gateway Service
	- Need for gateway
		- Client apps may need to store/remember multiple backend urls
		- Content type mismatch - JSON to XML /XML to JSON
		- Authentication cannot be added post deployment
		- Caching cannot implemented post deployment
		- Modification of response or request header is not possible
		- Replace text in response using find and replace
		- Control the number requests per minute (throttling)
	- AZure APIM
		- Fully managed PaaS service for Gateway purpose
		- 3 components
			- Publisher Portal (Azure Portal)
				- Used by API publishers
				- Configure the API backend in Gateway
				- Publisher Portal features are now integrated in Azure Portal
				- Products, APIS, Operations
				- Configure the Policies for APIs
			- Developer Portal
			- API Gateway
		- Policies
			- A set of rules that is configured by Publisher in gateway
			- Applied on Operation level, API level or Product level
